# Flood-and-Traffic-Light-Simulator

The following repository includes all the necessary files to run the flood and traffic light simulations using the SimPy library, with Unity integration for graphical support.  

To access the simulation, clone the repository in the terminal to reproduce the files directly on your machine and open the project in Unity Hub.  

To view the simulation on the web and access the SimPy code-generating chatbot, create a build of the project within Unity, select the destination folder, and export it for the web by clicking "Build and Run" in Unity. An HTML page will be automatically generated in the browser, containing buttons that will direct the user to other navigation pages, such as documentation and a message chat.
